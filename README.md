# supermarket-sales-analysis
I had the opportunity to work on a supermarket sales analysis project using Power BI tools. The project involved analyzing key data insights and designing an interactive dashboard that enables users to quickly understand sales performance across various product categories, regions, and customer segments.

ðŸ’¡ Key highlights:

* Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
* Normalization data and create the model
* Advanced DAX calculations for deriving insights
* Interactive dashboard for sales performance tracking
* Visualizations that highlight key trends and KPIs

I'm thrilled with how the dashboard turned out, offering intuitive navigation and clear insights to help stakeholders make informed business decisions.
